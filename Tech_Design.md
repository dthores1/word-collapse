## 1. Stack & top-level layout

| Concern | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Bundler / dev server | Vite 8 |
| UI framework | React 19 (no third-party state lib) |
| Styling | Tailwind v4 (CSS-first config via `@theme`) — no `tailwind.config.js` |
| Animations | Hand-written CSS keyframes + `transition: transform` on tiles. **No framer-motion.** |
| Word list | ENABLE dictionary, copied from Wordsmith (`public/enable-word-list.txt`) |
| Persistence | `localStorage` for per-difficulty personal bests + last-used name; remote leaderboard via `wordcollapse-api.fly.dev` (Fly + SQLite) |
| Module type | Native ESM (`"type": "module"`) |

Repository root is the React app — there is no `app/` subfolder. Files of note:

## 2. Visual / brand system

The design tokens in `src/index.css` mirror Wordsmith's so the two games
share typography and the calm-vs-danger color palette. Tailwind v4 reads
them via the CSS-first `@theme` block — every token surfaces as a utility
class (e.g. `text-primary-800`, `bg-danger-500`).

- Fonts (loaded from Google Fonts in `index.html`):
  - `font-sans`    Inter — body
  - `font-display` Plus Jakarta Sans — logo, scores, tile letters
  - `font-label`   Lexend — small uppercase labels
- Brand:
  - `primary-800` `#1e3a8a`  blue half of "Word"
  - `danger-500`  `#ef4444`  red half of "Collapse" + danger accents
  - `warn-500`    `#f59e0b`  combo / chain accent
- Page background mixes a faint blue glow top-right and red glow
  bottom-left (`body` background-image), reinforcing brand split.

### Animation primitives (defined in `index.css`)

| Class | Duration | Easing | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `.animate-fly-in` | 1100ms | ease-out | toasts (+points, COMBO x3, HUGE CLEAR, LIFELINE +1) |
| `.animate-shake` | 180ms | ease-in-out | invalid submit, row impact, bomb impact, near-overflow |
| `.animate-shake-hard` | 380ms | ease-in-out | game-over slam |
| `.animate-tile-clear` | 150ms | cubic-bezier(0.22,1,0.36,1) | a tile is being removed by a word clear |
| `.animate-tile-explode` | 280ms | cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1) | bomb-triggered tile clear (red flash + rotate) |
| `.animate-tile-land` | 160ms | cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1) | (defined; not yet wired) |
| `.animate-danger-pulse` | 1100ms loop | ease-in-out | board card glow when any column ≥ 4 |
| `.animate-red-flash` | 520ms | ease-out | red overlay at game-over |
| `.animate-tile-pop` | 240ms | cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1) | (defined; usable for staggered intros) |

Tile movement (gravity, row shift) is driven by a CSS `transition` on
the `transform` of each absolutely-positioned tile, not a keyframe. New
tiles enter from below by rendering at `row = ROWS` on first paint, then
swapping to their real `row` after `useLayoutEffect` + rAF — the CSS
transition animates the slide-in.

---

## 3. Game model

### Coordinates

The board is 5 columns × **10 rows** (geometry constants in
`game/constants.js`). **Origin is top-left**: row 0 is the top, row 9
is the bottom (where new rows arrive). Internally each column is
stored as a stack — `columns[c]` is an array of `Tile` objects,
**bottom-up**: `columns[c][0]` sits at row 9, `columns[c][i]` at
row `9 - i`. Empty cells (visual gaps in the column above the stack)
live at rows `0..(9 - stack.length)`.

Tile size is responsive (`useBoardGeometry`):

- **Desktop** (`availW ≥ 640`) — tiles fit-to-viewport, sized as
  `min(widthFit, heightFit, MAX_TILE_SIZE=46)`. The play UI tries
  hard to stay within one viewport so nothing scrolls during a round.
- **Mobile / narrow** (`availW < 640`) — tiles are sized by **width
  only**, capped at `NARROW_MAX_TILE_SIZE=64`. The 10-row board at
  width-fit sizes is taller than a typical phone viewport, so the
  page is allowed to scroll vertically — the tradeoff is large
  tappable tiles. Horizontal lifelines below the board keep the
  vertical overhead modest.

Game seeds **3 rows** at start (`INITIAL_ROWS = 3`) so the player
has real planning context from turn 0 and the playability scorer's
"highest occupied row" check is meaningful immediately.

```
visual row     col 0    col 1    col 2    col 3    col 4
   0           ·        ·        ·        ·        ·
   1           ·        ·        K        ·        ·
   2           ·        N        E        ·        ·
   3           ·        E        O        X        W
   4           S        L        O        G        A
```

Storing per-column stacks makes gravity trivial — after a clear we
just `Array.prototype.filter` each column to drop removed tiles, and
indices automatically re-pack toward the bottom. Indices changing
moves the tile's `(row, col)` derivation, which feeds straight into
the CSS `transform` transition.

### Tiles

Each tile has a globally-unique `id` (monotonic counter in `useGame.js`)
and an uppercase `letter`. The `id` is the React key for the tile
component, so the same DOM node persists as the tile moves around the
board — that's what lets the CSS transition animate position changes.

### Row arrival

A row enters by `unshift`ing a freshly-rolled tile onto each column.
Existing tiles' indices grow by 1, which means each tile's derived
`row` decreases by 1 (moves up by one). Overflow check happens
**before** the push: if any column is already at `ROWS` length,
adding another would exceed the visible grid → game over.

### Falling / gravity

After a clear, each column's tile array is filtered to remove cleared
ids. Remaining tiles shift toward index 0 (toward the bottom). Their
derived row positions change → CSS transition handles the fall.

### Path / adjacency

`game/path.js` exposes:

- `isAdjacent(a, b)` — true iff `|Δrow| ≤ 1`, `|Δcol| ≤ 1`, and the
  cells aren't identical (8-direction adjacency).
- `findPath(grid, word)` — exhaustive DFS from every matching starting
  cell. Returns the first path that spells `word` without revisiting a
  tile, or `null`. Search space is at most 25 cells × 8 neighbours per
  step — fast enough to call on every keystroke.

### Letter generation

Two layers in `game/letters.js`:

**1. Stratified row construction (`rollRow`)**
Rather than independently sampling 5 cells and rejection-checking the
result, we build each row by *slot purpose* and pick distinct letters
from each pool:

- Pick a vowel count of 2 or 3, biased by `difficulty.vowelBias`
  (Chill 0.46 → 3 vowels ~46%, Frenzy 0.34 → 3 vowels ~34%).
- Draw that many distinct vowels from the weighted pool
  `AAAEEEIIIOOUU` — repetitions in the pool give E/A/I higher
  selection probability without ever putting two of them in one row.
- Always include 1 R/S/T/L/N anchor.
- With probability `difficulty.rareLetterChance`, include 1 rare
  letter (J/Q/X/Z).
- Fill remaining slots with distinct, *digraph-biased* consonants:
  35% from `COMMON_HIGH = RSTLN`, 40% from `COMMON_MID = DHCMPG`
  (letters that form glue patterns like TH, SH, CH, CR, CL, PR, PL,
  GR, MP, ND), 25% from `COMMON_OTHER = BFKVWY` (long tail).
- Shuffle.

Hard guarantees: all 5 letters distinct, 2–3 vowels, ≤ 1 rare,
≥ 1 R/S/T/L/N anchor. No retries, no patchers — every roll is
structurally valid.

**2. Playability scoring (`rollPlayableRow`)**

This is the function the reducer actually calls. It draws
`QUALITY_ATTEMPTS` (= 20) candidate rows. For each candidate it
simulates arrival on the current columns, enumerates every distinct
3–5 letter word on the resulting grid (DFS, deduped, capped at 200)
**against the curated common-words dictionary** (≈ 12.7k entries —
not full ENABLE), and **scores** the candidate. The first candidate
that clears the per-difficulty threshold wins; if none clear the
bar after 20 attempts, the highest-scored candidate is returned as
a graceful fallback.

**Why two dictionaries?** Word *acceptance* (when the player
submits) uses full ENABLE so legal Scrabble plays still count.
Word *enumeration for playability* uses the common-words subset so
the scorer matches what a typical English-speaker can actually spot
under time pressure. Without this split, a board that's technically
rich but full of obscure entries (`firn`, `nidi`, `airn`, `aas`)
would falsely register as "playable". Verified on the user's
problematic `UTFAS / NDIHA / IRUGL` board: 86 distinct ENABLE words
collapse to 39 common words (still plenty — `fair`, `said`, `shag`,
`drug`, `hair`, `rift`, `gift`, `gash`, `shaft`, `shift`, `drift`,
…) but now the count actually predicts the player's experience.

This replaced an earlier "first row whose post-arrival grid contains
*any* 3+ letter ENABLE word" check, which let through rows whose new
tiles were islands — the dictionary find could be entirely on
unrelated tiles, leaving the player with a dead adjacency graph.

**Scoring rules**

```
+10 per distinct length-3 word
+20 per distinct length-4 word
+35 per distinct length-5 word
+5  if the word's path includes any new-row tile
+5  if the word's path includes any tile in the topmost occupied row
```

**Per-difficulty thresholds** (`DIFFICULTY[d].quality`):

```
chill:    minLongWords=4  minNewRowUses=2  minHighestUses=1
standard: minLongWords=2  minNewRowUses=1  minHighestUses=1
frenzy:   minLongWords=1  minNewRowUses=0  minHighestUses=0
```

`minLongWords` counts distinct **4–5 letter** words (not 3+). ENABLE
is permissive with obscure 3-letter entries (`aa`, `aal`, `ait`,
`fas`, `dit`, ...) that don't translate to "a human will spot this
under time pressure"; the length-4+ count correlates much better
with player-perceived playability.

`minNewRowUses` and `minHighestUses` count words of *any* length
(≥3) whose paths involve those rows. A row of new tiles that
doesn't contribute to any word is by definition not integrating
with the rest of the board.

**Seed-row exception**

When `columns` is empty (game start), thresholds are relaxed to
`{ minLongWords: 0, minNewRowUses: 0, minHighestUses: 0 }` because a
single 5-tile linear strip can naturally only produce a handful of
horizontally-connected words.

**Graceful degradation**

If pathological RNG produces 20 candidates that all miss the bar,
the highest-scoring candidate wins anyway. Empirically (smoke test:
50 trials per difficulty, 3 sequential rows each) every difficulty
hit the threshold on every trial with averages of ~50+ length-4+
words per board. The fallback path is a defensive guard, not the
norm.

The dictionary lives on reducer state (set via `SET_DICTIONARY` in a
`useEffect` watching the `dictionary` prop), so this validation runs
inside reducer-pure functions without needing outer-scope refs.

**Performance**

Per arrival: ~1.5ms in Node, well under the 16ms budget for a 60Hz
visual frame and only triggered ~once every 5–15s anyway. The
DFS-with-`visited`-Set has bounded explosion (max 8·7·6·5 = 1680
paths per starting cell at length 5, capped at 200 distinct words
total per board).

### Scoring

`scoring.js`:

- `wordBasePoints(word)` = `10 * length + 5 * (length - 3)^2`
- `awardPoints({ word, comboCount, chainStep })`
  = `base × (1 + 0.25 × max(0, combo-1)) × (1 + 0.5 × max(0, chain-1))`

`combo` is the number of consecutive clears within `COMBO_WINDOW_MS`
(4 seconds). It increments on each successful clear and resets to 0
when the window lapses without another clear. `chain` is wired but
always `1` today — we don't yet auto-clear gravity-formed words.

Bonus toasts:
- Every clear → `+N` toast.
- Combo ≥ 2 → extra `COMBO x{n}` toast.
- Path length ≥ 6 → extra `HUGE CLEAR` toast.

### Difficulty (in `constants.js`)

```
chill      seconds=15.0  pressureFloor=10.0  acceleratePerWord=0.985  vowelBias=0.46  rare=0.02
standard   seconds=10.0  pressureFloor=6.0   acceleratePerWord=0.975  vowelBias=0.40  rare=0.05
frenzy     seconds=7.0   pressureFloor=4.0   acceleratePerWord=0.96   vowelBias=0.34  rare=0.10
```

- `seconds` is the **starting** row interval.
- `acceleratePerWord` is multiplied into `rowInterval` on each clear,
  clamped at `pressureFloor` (in seconds).
- `pressureFactor(columns)` shaves up to 25% off the *effective*
  interval as the board fills (used only for the progress bar — base
  interval is unaffected so the cadence isn't permanently faster).

## 4. State machine

`useGame(dictionary)` is a `useReducer` plus a single `requestAnimationFrame`
loop. The reducer is the only place state changes.

### Phases

`'idle' | 'playing' | 'gameover'` — controlled by `App.jsx` which renders
the matching screen.

### Actions

| Action | Trigger | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `START_GAME` | TitleScreen "Play" or GameOverScreen "Play again" | Resets state, picks first `nextRow`, sets phase = playing |
| `SET_DIFFICULTY` | TitleScreen card click | Only valid in idle |
| `STOP_GAME` | Red stop button on PlayScreen | Phase → gameover |
| `RESET` | "Main Menu" on GameOverScreen | Phase → idle, difficulty preserved |
| `TICK` | rAF loop (only while phase=playing) | Advances `rowProgress`, `elapsedMs`, expires combo + toasts; if `rowProgress ≥ 1` and no clear is in flight, calls `arriveRow` inline |
| `ARRIVE_ROW` | (Only via TICK today) | Pushes `nextRow` onto bottom of every column. If any column was full → phase = gameover + heavy shake + red flash |
| `CLEAR_START` | `submitPath` on a valid word | Marks tile ids as `clearingIds`; tiles get the `.animate-tile-clear` class |
| `CLEAR_END` | `setTimeout(ANIM.tileClear)` after CLEAR_START | Filters cleared tiles out of columns (causing gravity), awards points + combo, queues toasts, shrinks `rowInterval` |
| `INVALID` | `submitPath` rejects (too short / unknown / no path) | Increments `shakeKey` to retrigger board shake |

### Board-arrival deferral

`TICK` will *not* trigger `ARRIVE_ROW` while `clearingIds.size > 0`.
Reason: clear and arrival animations overlapping looks chaotic. The
defer is invisible because clear animations finish in ~150ms.

### Manual invariants worth knowing

- A new tile's `id` is assigned **once** at row roll time (or on a fresh
  arrival in `applyArrival`). It must never change.
- `columns` is *always* per-column-stacks, length ≤ ROWS.
- The 2D `grid[row][col]` view is **derived** in `useGame` via
  `useMemo` — never stored back.

---

## 4½. Lifelines

Two single-purpose actions the player can spend to relieve pressure.
Constants live in `constants.js`:

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LIFELINE_INITIAL_USES` | 2 | Starting count for each lifeline at game start |
| `LIFELINE_MAX` | 3 | Cap on accumulated uses |
| `LIFELINE_REGEN_EVERY_WORDS` | 8 | Each `N`-th cleared word grants +1 to **each** lifeline |

Both are tracked on reducer state (`bombUses`, `collapseUses`).
`CLEAR_END` (the action that finalises a successful word) is also the
regen tick — when `wordsCount` becomes a multiple of
`LIFELINE_REGEN_EVERY_WORDS`, both lifelines get +1 (capped) and a
`LIFELINE +1` toast is queued.

### Bomb (`useBomb`)

Algorithm (`game/lifelines.js → bombTargetIds`): walks the grid view
from `target = COLS` down to `target = 1`; for each target tile-count
walks rows top-down (row 0 first) and returns the ids of the first
row whose populated count equals `target`. So a row of 5 wins over a
row of 4; among 4-tile rows, the topmost (closest to overflow) wins.

Reducer flow: `BOMB_START` records ids in `explodingIds` and
decrements `bombUses` (no-op if the board is empty — use is refunded
by never being decremented). `Tile` renders any id in `explodingIds`
with `.animate-tile-explode` (280 ms punchier-than-clear keyframe
with stagger via inline `animation-delay` so the row reads as a
chained blast). `BOMB_END` (scheduled after `ANIM.tileExplode`)
removes the tiles via the existing per-column filter, and
gravity / column compaction follows automatically.

No score, no combo, no rowInterval shrinkage — bomb is purely
relief.

### Collapse (`useCollapse`)

Algorithm (`game/lifelines.js → computeCollapse`): given the current
per-column stacks containing `N` total tiles, computes target heights
`[fullRows + 1, …, fullRows + 1, fullRows, …, fullRows]` where
`fullRows = floor(N / COLS)` and the leftmost `N % COLS` columns get
the +1. Then pops excess tiles off the top of any over-tall column
(left → right) into a queue, and pushes from the queue onto any
under-tall column's top (also left → right).

The bottom of every column is preserved, so any near-overflow word
patterns the player was eyeing don't get scrambled. CSS `transform`
transitions on tile elements drive the visual fall — no custom
keyframes needed for the repack itself.

The reducer refuses to consume a use if the algorithm reports
`changed: false` (the board is already in a collapsed shape).

Worked example for the canonical case (heights `[5, 2, 2, 2, 5]`,
16 tiles): result heights `[4, 3, 3, 3, 3]`. The top tiles of cols
0 and 4 (3 spilled total) land atop cols 1, 2, 3 in left-to-right
order. Bottom rows of every column stay put.

## 5. Input

`PlayScreen.jsx` owns the canonical `selection` state (the path of
chosen tiles). `Board.jsx` is a controlled component — it receives
`selection`, mutates it via `onSelectionChange`, and signals commits
via `onCommit`. PlayScreen also owns `typed` (the keyboard string).
Three input flows feed the same selection:

- **Drag** — pointer-down on a tile starts the path; pointer-move
  extends through 8-adjacent neighbours; backtracking by dragging
  back over the second-to-last tile pops the last entry. Pointer-up
  *after movement* commits unconditionally (PlayScreen rejects
  too-short paths).
- **Tap-build** — pointer-up *without movement* is treated as a tap
  rather than a drag and **does not clear the path**. Subsequent taps
  extend / backtrack the selection:
    - Tap an adjacent tile not in the path → extend.
    - Tap a non-last tile already in the path → truncate to it.
    - Tap a non-adjacent tile not in the path → start over.
    - Tap the *last* selected tile → commit on the matching pointer-up
      (or, if the path is < 3 long, just clear).
  The same Enter key the keyboard uses also commits an in-progress
  tap selection.
- **Keyboard** — `<input>` tracks `typed`. Each keystroke runs
  `findPath(grid, typed)` and highlights the resolved tiles. `Enter`
  submits, `Escape` clears. **Desktop only**: on narrow viewports
  (`window.innerWidth < 640`) the entire input card is `hidden` and
  the auto-focus useEffect short-circuits, so the on-screen keyboard
  never appears. Mobile players have no word display at all — the
  selection is conveyed by tile highlight + connecting line, and the
  ✓ FAB on the board's bottom-right corner serves as both submit and
  live validity cue (see Submit button below).
- **Submit button (✓)** — two placements share the same
  `SubmitButton` component with a `large` prop:
    - **Desktop** — small 36×36 button inside the input card on the
      right.
    - **Mobile** — large 56×56 FAB anchored to the board's
      bottom-right corner (`absolute -bottom-3 -right-3 z-10`),
      rendered as a sibling of `<Board>`.
  Three visual states (both placements): disabled grey when length <
  3 or no realisable path; primary navy when length ≥ 3 but the word
  isn't in ENABLE (clickable, will trigger the shake reject); success
  green when the word is in ENABLE (clickable, will score). On
  desktop, paired with a one-shot session hint that surfaces the
  first time a tap-built selection reaches 3 letters — the hint is
  omitted on mobile since the FAB itself is unmissable.

Mode-switch rules:

- Typing always wins: any input change drops the in-flight tile
  selection so the input becomes the source of truth.
- When `game.grid` mutates (clear or arrival), the selection is
  reset because tile ids may have moved or vanished.
- Auto-focus on the input fires whenever phase is `playing`, so
  typing-only play needs no clicks.
- **Global letter capture** — a window-level `keydown` listener (only
  active during `phase === 'playing'`) catches single-letter
  keystrokes when the input isn't focused, focuses it, and manually
  appends the letter via `handleTypedChange`. Browsers don't
  reliably forward the keystroke that started focus, so the manual
  append is required. Cmd/Ctrl/Alt-modified keys are ignored.

### Visual feedback during selection

- Selected tiles render in primary navy with a `scale: 1.05` boost.
- A single SVG `polyline` underlays the selected path, drawn in
  semi-transparent navy. Path order is preserved by iterating
  `selectedIds` (a `Set` whose insertion order matches path order).

## 6. Animations / game feel — implementation notes

- **Row arrival** — handled by tile `transform` transitions plus the
  "first paint at row=ROWS" trick in `Tile`. Tiles slide in from
  below in 200ms with `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.8, 0.25, 1)`.
- **Tile clear** — pure CSS keyframe (`tile-clear`) at 150ms; React
  unmounts the tile after the keyframe via the `setTimeout` in
  `submitPath`.
- **Gravity** — same 200ms `transform` transition, no extra code; it
  fires automatically when column indices change.
- **Combo / chain feedback** — toasts come out of the reducer
  (`CLEAR_END`) and render with `animate-fly-in`. They self-prune in
  `TICK` once `now >= expiresAt`.
- **Danger** — `useGame.danger` is true when any column has ≥ 4 tiles.
  The board card gets `animate-danger-pulse` (red glow ring) and the
  next-row progress bar swaps to a darker red gradient.
- **Shake** — `Board` listens to `shakeKey` / `hardShakeKey` props and
  re-applies the corresponding class via DOM mutation + reflow trick.
  Reducer increments those counters at:
  - **shakeKey** — invalid submit, near-overflow row arrival.
  - **hardShakeKey** — overflow (game over).
- **Red flash** — same trick on a `RedFlash` overlay div, driven by
  `redFlashKey` (incremented at game-over).

## 7. Persistence

Two layers, deliberately separate so the game stays playable when the
network is down or the leaderboard service is asleep.

### Local — `useHighScore` (`localStorage`)

`wordcollapse:highscore:v1` stores per-difficulty personal bests:

```json
{
  "chill":    { "name": "Dan", "score": 412 } | null,
  "standard": null,
  "frenzy":   null
}
```

`wordcollapse:lastname:v1` stores the most recently submitted player
name as a bare string so the game-over input can pre-fill it on the
next round. Written only when a name is non-empty.

The `storage` event listener keeps both keys live across tabs.

### Remote — `useLeaderboard` + `lib/leaderboard.js`

API base: `https://wordcollapse-api.fly.dev` (Fly app `wordcollapse-api`,
single `shared-cpu-1x` machine, SQLite on a 1 GB volume mounted at
`/data`). Endpoints used:

- `GET /leaderboard?difficulty=<chill|standard|frenzy>&limit=10` →
  array of `{ player_name, score, words, best_word, created_at }`,
  sorted by score desc.
- `POST /submit-score` → body
  `{ difficulty, player_name, score, words, best_word }`.

`fetch` wrapper details:

- 8-second `AbortController` timeout. The Fly machine `auto_stops` when
  idle, so the first request after a quiet period takes ~1–2s to wake;
  8s gives the cold start headroom without leaving the UI hung if the
  service is genuinely down.
- Response normalization tolerates either a bare array or
  `{ leaderboard: [...] }` — the live API returns the bare form today.
- `Content-Type: application/json` for both verbs; no auth headers
  (CORS is wide open server-side per the deployment notes).

### Submit flow (game-over)

1. Player reaches `phase === 'gameover'`. `useLeaderboard` is enabled
   only in this phase (`enabled: game.phase === 'gameover'`) so we
   don't wake the Fly machine on the title screen.
2. Hook fetches top-10 for the played difficulty. While loading, the
   game-over screen shows a "Loading scores…" placeholder.
3. `qualifies(score)` returns true when `score > 0` AND either the
   board has < 10 entries or `score > entries[entries.length - 1].score`.
   Returns false during loading or after a fetch error so we never
   show a stale prompt.
4. If qualified and not yet submitted, the name input appears
   (pre-filled with `useHighScore.lastName`). Submit POSTs the score,
   then re-fetches the leaderboard so the player's row appears in the
   list and gets highlighted (`bg-secondary-50`, primary-blue text).
5. After a successful API submit, `App.handleSubmit` also calls
   `high.submit()` to mirror the entry into the local personal-best
   row — keeping the title screen's per-difficulty card in sync.
6. If the POST fails, `saved` is rolled back so the player can retry;
   a `text-danger-600` line surfaces the error inline.

### Sub-top-10 personal bests — known gap

A player whose score is a new personal best but does NOT crack the
top-10 leaderboard sees no name prompt by design (per UX choice
"Only if it qualifies for top 10"), and so their local high score is
not updated either. The previous best stays on the title screen even
though they exceeded it. Acceptable tradeoff for now; revisit if
players complain.

## 8. Setup / run

```bash
# Install
npm install

# Dev (Vite, hot-reload)
npm run dev

# Production build → dist/
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The dictionary is served as a static file from `public/`. No server is
required for play.

---

## 8½. Failure-mode notebook

A running record of in-game failure modes the player has surfaced and
how the system responded. Useful when revisiting a balance lever later
to remember *why* it was set the way it was.

### Dead adjacency graph (resolved 2026-05-08)

**Symptom.** Player got three rows where the letters were
"reasonable English-looking" individually but produced a board with
no obvious play. Example: `UTFAS / NDIHA / IRUGL` — the player felt
like nothing connected.

**Root cause.** The previous playability check was *"does any 3+
letter ENABLE word exist anywhere on the post-arrival grid"*. That
passes even when the new row is an island of letters disconnected
from the rest of the board's word potential — the dictionary find
could be entirely on unrelated tiles.

**Fix.** Switched to a candidate-scoring pipeline (see
"Playability scoring" above). Per-difficulty thresholds now require
words to *involve* the new row and the danger row, not just exist
somewhere.

**Update 2026-05-09 — common-words dictionary added.** Curated
~12.7k entry file `public/common-words.txt` now feeds the
playability scorer (acceptance still uses ENABLE). On the user's
example board, 86 ENABLE matches collapse to 39 common-word
matches (`fair`, `said`, `shag`, `drug`, `hair`, `rift`, `gift`,
`gash`, `shaft`, `shift`, `drift`, …) — the metric now correlates
with what a typical player would recognize under time pressure
rather than overcounting via Scrabble-tournament short words.

## 9. Known gaps / next steps

- **No automated tests** — gameplay logic in `path.js`, `scoring.js`,
  `letters.js`, and the reducer are all easy to unit-test (Vitest +
  React Testing Library would slot in cleanly).
- **No chain reactions yet** — `awardPoints` accepts a `chainStep`
  multiplier but always passes 1. Auto-detecting and clearing
  cascade-formed words after gravity is the natural next feature.
- **No sound** — design feedback hints at audio for danger/impact;
  not wired.
- **No mid-game pause** — design is "no pausing during interactions",
  so this is intentional.
- **Game-over flash → recap** is instant. The mockup feedback
  recommended a brief freeze before the recap UI; we currently fade
  straight to the GameOverScreen.
- **Toast layout** — toasts stack with a fixed 12px offset; if many
  fire at once they overlap. Acceptable while combos are bounded
  (at most 2 toasts per clear), but would need a queue/lane system
  in a heavier feature pass.

## 10. Change log

- **2026-05-12 — Mobile keyboard + scroll fixes.**
  - **No `<input>` or word card on mobile.** PlayScreen's input card
    is now `hidden sm:flex` — desktop keeps the real `<input>` for
    keyboard play, mobile shows nothing in its place. The auto-focus
    useEffect short-circuits when `window.innerWidth < 640`, so
    nothing summons the on-screen keyboard. The current word being
    built is conveyed entirely by tile highlight + connecting line
    on the board. Closes the *"keyboard pops up and eats half the
    screen the moment the round starts (and stays up when tapping
    tiles)"* report.
    - Earlier draft kept a read-only word display panel on mobile;
      removed after the user confirmed they wanted no card at all.
  - **Mobile ✓ FAB on the board.** New `large` prop on
    `SubmitButton` (56×56, rounded-2xl, larger check icon).
    Rendered as a sibling of `<Board>` inside the board area with
    `absolute -bottom-3 -right-3 z-10 sm:hidden`, so it overlaps
    the board card's bottom-right corner. Same three color states
    as the desktop ✓ — grey disabled / navy clickable-but-invalid /
    green valid-word — so the FAB doubles as a live validity cue.
    Disabled state gets a subtle border so it doesn't blend into
    the paper-colored board card.
  - **Per-tile `touch-action` instead of container-wide.** `Board.jsx`
    used to set `touch-action: none` on the whole grid container,
    which blocked vertical page scroll when the finger was anywhere
    on the board. Moved `touch-action: none` onto the absolutely
    positioned tile elements only; the container and the empty-cell
    placeholders default to `auto`, so touches on empty grid space
    let the page scroll. Drag-selects still capture cleanly because
    they begin on a tile (where `touch-action: none` applies) and
    `setPointerCapture` carries the gesture across the rest of the
    grid. Closes the *"can't scroll the page while touching the
    board"* report.

- **2026-05-11 — Aggressive mobile consolidation.**
  - **Single top action bar on mobile.** Restructured the PlayScreen
    header into two parallel renders: a compact mobile bar
    (`flex sm:hidden`) holding `[⏰ timer · score · stop · 💣 · ⬇]`,
    and the original two-group desktop header (`hidden sm:flex`).
    Difficulty card and words count are dropped on mobile — difficulty
    is a round-start choice and words count is available on the
    gameover screen.
  - **Lifelines moved into the mobile header.** Lifelines no longer
    render below the board on mobile; they're now the rightmost
    elements in the top action bar. Tradeoff acknowledged: lifelines
    are out of the easy-reach thumb zone, but stay one tap away from
    every gameplay moment, and the previously-stacked horizontal
    row below the board cost ~70 px of vertical real estate.
  - **`LifelinePanel` gains a `compact` prop.** Compact = 40 × 40 px
    rounded-xl buttons with smaller icons (20 px) and a smaller
    16 px badge; horizontal flex always. Default unchanged (64 × 64
    rounded-2xl vertical for the desktop sidecar).
  - **Desktop lifelines moved to `hidden sm:flex` sidecar only.**
    The old mobile-stacked lifeline row below the board has been
    removed; only the absolute-positioned right-side sidecar
    remains, gated by `sm:` breakpoint.

- **2026-05-11 — Mobile polish pass.**
  - **Width-driven tile sizing on narrow viewports.** `useBoardGeometry`
    now branches on `availW < NARROW_VIEWPORT_BREAKPOINT (640px)`: on
    narrow widths it ignores the height constraint and uses width-only
    sizing capped at `NARROW_MAX_TILE_SIZE=64`. The page is allowed to
    scroll vertically on mobile — the tradeoff is tap-target tiles
    that fill the horizontal space, which the player explicitly asked
    for. Desktop branch unchanged (still fit-to-viewport with cap 46).
  - **Horizontal lifelines on mobile.** `LifelinePanel` is now
    `flex gap-3 sm:flex-col` — row of two buttons below the board on
    mobile, column sidecar on desktop. Cuts the vertical overhead of
    the lifeline area roughly in half.
  - **PlayScreen layout drops fit-to-viewport on mobile.** Outer
    container is now `sm:flex sm:flex-col` (no flex on mobile) and the
    inner container loses `flex-1 min-h-0` on mobile so content can
    push the page taller than the viewport. Header gets tighter mobile
    spacing: `gap-2 sm:gap-3`, smaller score (`text-3xl sm:text-5xl`),
    smaller stop button (`w-10 sm:w-11`), and slimmer difficulty card
    padding.
  - **GameOver Save button overflow fix.** Name input + Save are now
    `flex flex-col gap-3 sm:flex-row` so on mobile they stack
    vertically (button gets `w-full sm:w-auto`); on desktop they
    stay side-by-side. Outer card padding reduced from
    `p-8 sm:p-12` to `p-5 sm:p-12` and outer page padding from
    `px-4 py-8` to `px-3 py-6 sm:px-4 sm:py-8` so the card breathes
    on narrow phones.
  - **Title screen high score now uses the live leaderboard.** App
    enables `useLeaderboard` whenever `game.phase !== 'playing'`,
    keyed off `pendingDifficulty` on the title screen and
    `game.difficulty` on gameover. The title's "High Score" card
    prefers the global top-1 entry from the leaderboard, falling back
    to the local personal best when the network hasn't responded yet
    or the leaderboard is empty. Shows a `Loading…` placeholder while
    the cold-start fetch is in flight. Closes the *"first visit shows
    No score yet"* gap.

- **2026-05-10 — Remote leaderboard wired up.**
  - **API service.** Hooked the game to `wordcollapse-api.fly.dev`
    (Fly app, single shared-cpu-1x machine in `sjc`, SQLite on a
    1 GB volume at `/data`). Endpoints: `GET /leaderboard`,
    `POST /submit-score`, `GET /health`.
  - **New files.** `src/lib/leaderboard.js` (fetch wrapper with 8s
    `AbortController` timeout for the Fly cold-start window;
    normalizes either `[...]` or `{ leaderboard: [...] }`),
    `src/hooks/useLeaderboard.js` (per-difficulty fetch + `qualifies()`
    + `submit()` + stale-response guard via a `reqIdRef`).
  - **Submit-flow UX (per user choice).** Name prompt fires
    *only* when the score qualifies for the top 10 — i.e. board has
    < 10 entries OR score beats the 10th-place cutoff. Sub-top-10
    personal bests no longer prompt and so don't update local high
    score either; documented as an explicit known gap in §7.
  - **GameOverScreen** now renders a top-10 leaderboard panel for
    the played difficulty (loading / error / empty / list states),
    highlighting the player's just-submitted entry with
    `bg-secondary-50` + primary-blue text. Submit button shows
    `Saving…` and disables during the POST; failure surfaces an
    inline `text-danger-600` retry message and rolls back the
    `saved` flag so the player can resubmit.
  - **Name pre-fill.** `useHighScore` gained a `lastName` field
    backed by `wordcollapse:lastname:v1` in localStorage. Saved on
    every successful submit, pre-filled into the game-over input on
    the next round.
  - **App.jsx** instantiates `useLeaderboard(game.difficulty,
    { enabled: game.phase === 'gameover' })` so the Fly machine only
    wakes on game-over — title-screen visits don't poke it. The new
    `handleSubmit(name)` calls `leaderboard.submit()` first, then
    mirrors a successful result into `high.submit()` so the
    title-screen personal-best card stays in sync.
  - **Build verified** (`npx vite build` — clean, 232 kB JS / 35 kB
    CSS); dev server boots; `GET /health` and
    `GET /leaderboard?difficulty=standard&limit=10` both responded
    successfully against the live API. **Not yet manually exercised
    in a browser end-to-end** — the qualifies/highlight/error
    branches are covered by the implementation but unverified by a
    play session.
  - **Bugfix (same day).** Pre-fill name input was uneditable —
    clearing the field re-snapped to `lastName`. Cause: a defensive
    `useEffect([lastName, name])` was rehydrating the input on every
    keystroke that emptied it. `useHighScore` already reads
    `lastName` synchronously in the `useState` initializer, so the
    `useState(lastName || '')` initial value is always present on
    the first render — the effect was redundant. Removed it.

- **2026-05-09 — Iteration 6: submit button, validity cue, ambient cleanup.**
  - **Submit button inside the input.** New `SubmitButton`
    component lives on the right side of the input card. Three
    states: disabled grey (`< 3` chars or no realisable path),
    primary navy (length OK, not in ENABLE — will shake on submit),
    success green (in ENABLE — will score). Click fires the same
    `handleEnter` path as the Enter key. Closes the
    "tap-mode-with-no-keyboard" UX gap on mobile.
  - **One-shot submit hint.** First time a tap-built selection
    reaches `MIN_WORD_LENGTH` in a session, a small label fades in
    under the input: *"Tap ✓ or the last letter again to submit."*
    Hidden on first commit (and also rendered with reserved height
    so its appearance doesn't shift the page).
  - **Validity cue uses ENABLE.** The button's "valid word" highlight
    queries the full ENABLE dictionary (the acceptance check),
    threaded into PlayScreen as a new `dictionary` prop from
    `App.jsx`.
  - **Ambient gradient cleanup.** Dropped the bottom-left red glow
    from the body background — with the taller 10-row board it
    bled into the play area and read as an unintentional smudge
    rather than a brand accent. Kept the subtle blue at top-right.

- **2026-05-09 — Iteration 5: common-words, taller board, alignment, countdown.**
  - **Common-words dictionary.** New `public/common-words.txt`
    (~12.7k curated 3–7 letter entries — sorted, dedup'd, filtered
    against ENABLE). Loaded in parallel with ENABLE via
    `useDictionary` and threaded through to `rollPlayableRow`. The
    playability scorer now enumerates against the common-words set
    while word **acceptance** still uses ENABLE. Verified: the
    user's `UTFAS / NDIHA / IRUGL` board drops from 86 ENABLE
    matches to 39 common-word matches (still plenty, but the words
    are actually recognizable: `fair`, `said`, `shag`, `drug`,
    `hair`, `rift`, `gift`, `gash`, `shaft`, `shift`, `drift`).
    All 3 difficulties hit thresholds 50/50 trials at ~2ms/row.
  - **Taller board.** `ROWS = 10` (was 5), `TILE_SIZE = 46` (was
    64), `TILE_GAP = 6` (was 8) — board is 254×494 px, fits a
    laptop viewport but gives the player real breathing room before
    overflow becomes a concern.
  - **Multi-row seed.** `INITIAL_ROWS = 3` (was 1). `START_GAME`
    pumps three rows in sequentially through the playability
    scorer so each seed row is held to the same bar as runtime
    arrivals. Gives the player planning context from turn 0 and
    makes the "highest occupied row" check meaningful immediately.
  - **Alignment fix.** Lifelines were rendered as a flex sibling of
    the board, which shifted the board off the page's true center
    and made input + next-row preview look offset. Refactored to
    `flex flex-col items-center` for the input/board/next-row
    column with lifelines absolute-positioned off the board's
    right edge — board, input, and next-row preview all share the
    same horizontal axis.
  - **Next-row countdown.** New `nextRowRemainingMs` derived from
    `rowProgress`, `rowInterval`, and the fullness pressure
    factor; rendered as `Xs` (whole seconds when ≥ 3, one decimal
    when < 3 for endgame urgency) inline with the "NEXT ROW"
    label. Turns red in danger state.

- **2026-05-08 — Iteration 4: candidate-scored row generation.**
  - **Problem.** Prior generator passed any row that produced "any
    3+ letter ENABLE word anywhere on the board" — letting through
    rows whose new tiles formed an island disconnected from the rest
    of the adjacency graph. Surfaced via player feedback on a
    `UTFAS / NDIHA / IRUGL` board that felt unplayable.
  - **Fix.** Replaced the boolean check with a scoring pipeline.
    `rollPlayableRow` now draws 20 candidates, scores each by
    distinct-word count (weighted by length 3/4/5 → 10/20/35) plus
    +5 bonuses for words involving the new row or the topmost
    occupied row, and returns the first candidate to clear a
    per-difficulty threshold. If none pass, the highest-scored
    candidate falls through.
  - **Thresholds** stored in `DIFFICULTY[d].quality`:
    Chill `4-long-words / 2-new-row / 1-highest`,
    Standard `2 / 1 / 1`,
    Frenzy `1 / 0 / 0`. The "long words" count is length ≥ 4 because
    ENABLE is generous with obscure 3-letter entries that wouldn't
    register as words to a typical player. Seed row at game start
    uses relaxed `{ 0, 0, 0 }` thresholds (linear strip, low ceiling).
  - **Letter pools refactored** into three tiers — `RSTLN` anchors,
    `DHCMPG` digraph-friendly mid (forms TH/SH/CH/CR/CL/PR/PL/GR/MP/ND),
    `BFKVWY` long tail. Fill-letter bias is 35/40/25, concentrating
    rows on letters that actually form glue patterns. Anchor still
    guaranteed from RSTLN.
  - **Performance.** Per-arrival cost ~1.5ms in Node. DFS path
    explosion bounded by 200-distinct-words cap.
  - **Smoke test (50 trials × 3 sequential rows × 3 difficulties).**
    All trials hit the threshold on the first qualifying candidate,
    averaged 50+ length-4+ words per resulting board. The fallback
    "best-scored" branch is a defensive guard, not the norm.
  - **Open caveat documented in §8½** — the example player board
    that triggered this iteration actually has 86 distinct words on
    its own and would have passed the new check. The fix improves
    candidate selection but doesn't fully address player perception
    when ENABLE entries are obscure. Possible follow-ups: curated
    common-words subset for the playability check, hint lifeline,
    further-slowed cadence.

- **2026-05-08 — Iteration 3: lifelines + input polish.**
  - **Lifelines.** Added `Bomb` and `Collapse` lifelines with badged
    buttons rendered to the right of the board (`LifelinePanel.jsx`).
    Each starts with 2 uses, regenerates +1 to *each* every 8 cleared
    words, capped at 3. Algorithms live in `game/lifelines.js`:
      - **Bomb** scans rows top-down for the row with the highest
        tile count and clears those tiles with a punchier
        `tile-explode` keyframe (staggered via inline
        `animation-delay`). No score / combo / cadence change.
      - **Collapse** repacks per-column stacks to stair-stepped
        target heights (leftmost columns get the +1 partial) by
        spilling tops of over-tall columns into shorter columns.
        Bottom rows preserved; CSS transform transition handles the
        fall. Reducer skips burning a use if no change would result.
  - **Lifeline regen tick.** `CLEAR_END` now grants +1 to each
    lifeline every `LIFELINE_REGEN_EVERY_WORDS` words and queues a
    `LIFELINE +1` toast.
  - **Smaller word input.** Constrained to `max-w-sm`, reduced
    vertical padding, smaller font; centered horizontally.
  - **Auto-focus on letter keypress.** A global `keydown` listener
    (active only during `phase === 'playing'`) catches single-letter
    keystrokes when the input isn't focused, focuses it, and
    manually appends the letter via `handleTypedChange` (the natural
    keystroke is dropped during focus transition by the browser).
  - **Microcopy.** Input placeholder updated from `Connect letters`
    to `Create words` (user edit).
  - **Tech_Design** sections updated: file map, animation table,
    new §4½ Lifelines, input section now describes global letter
    capture.

- **2026-05-08 — Iteration 2: stratified letter rolling.**
  - User reported a row of `I T E E E` (three duplicate Es). Replaced
    the reject-sampling row generator with a constructive,
    stratified one in `letters.js`. Each roll now picks vowel count
    (2 or 3, biased by difficulty) → distinct vowels → 1 anchor →
    optional 1 rare → distinct fill consonants → shuffle. No retries
    needed; every row is structurally valid by construction.
  - Hard-coded guarantees per row: **all 5 letters unique**, **2–3
    vowels**, **≤ 1 rare letter**, **≥ 1 R/S/T/L/N anchor**.
  - `rollPlayableRow` (the dictionary-aware wrapper) is unchanged —
    it still simulates arrival and probes for any 3-/4-letter
    ENABLE word, retrying up to 8x if the resulting grid has none.
  - Removed the now-unused `rollLetter` export and the `rowMeetsConstraints`
    + `patchRow` helpers; deleted the `VOWEL_SET`/`HIGH_SET`/`RARE_SET`
    membership-check sets that only existed for the old patcher.
  - Smoke test (10 sample rows, Standard difficulty) showed every row
    matched the new guarantees.

- **2026-05-07 — Iteration 1.** User feedback driven.
  - **Initial board not empty.** `START_GAME` now seeds `columns` with
    one fully-populated row so the player isn't staring at an empty
    grid waiting for the first arrival.
  - **Slower default cadence.** Difficulty timings raised from 7/5/3s
    to 15/10/7s; pressure floors lifted to 10/6/4s.
  - **Title-screen casing fix.** The difficulty card subtitle (`5s PER
    ROW`) was being CSS-uppercased into `5S PER ROW`. Removed the
    `uppercase` Tailwind class on that span; the literal string now
    drives casing (lowercase `s`, uppercase `PER ROW`).
  - **Tap-to-build selection.** Board pointer model now distinguishes
    tap from drag: pointer-up without movement preserves the
    selection so the player can tap-tap-tap a word, then re-tap the
    last letter (or press Enter) to commit. Drag still commits on
    release. Selection state is now owned by PlayScreen and Board is
    a controlled component (`selection` + `onSelectionChange` +
    `onCommit`).
  - **Smarter letter generation.** `rollRow` now enforces ≥2 vowels,
    ≤1 rare letter, ≥1 R/S/T/L/N anchor (retries up to 8x, with a
    deterministic patcher fallback). On top of that, `rollPlayableRow`
    simulates the row arriving on the current board and DFS-probes
    the resulting grid for any 3-/4-letter ENABLE word — retries up
    to 8x if no realisable word exists. Dictionary lives on reducer
    state via a new `SET_DICTIONARY` action.

- **2026-05-07 — Initial scaffold.**
  - Vite 8 + React 19 + Tailwind v4 project bootstrapped at repo root.
  - Wordsmith design tokens ported into `src/index.css`; ENABLE word
    list copied to `public/`.
  - Game model: per-column stacks, derived 2D grid, 8-direction DFS
    path finder, difficulty-weighted letter generation, combo-aware
    scoring.
  - `useGame` reducer with all phase transitions; rAF-driven TICK
    loop drives row cadence + clock; clear→gravity flow uses a 150ms
    timeout to let the clear animation play before tiles unmount.
  - PlayScreen wires drag (pointer-captured on Board) + keyboard
    (controlled input + live `findPath`) to one `selectedIds` set.
  - Animations: tile slide-in from below the board, gravity via
    transform transitions, tile-clear keyframe, danger pulse, shake +
    hard shake on dedicated counters, red-flash overlay at game over.
  - Per-difficulty high score persisted in `localStorage`.
  - Build verified (`npm run build`); dev server confirmed serving on
    localhost. **Gameplay has not yet been manually exercised in a
    browser — first run will likely surface UX polish opportunities.**
